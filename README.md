Beginner-level C projects showcasing my growth in programming and problem-solving skills.<br>
<br>
This repository contains some of my best early stage projects that helped me understand the fundamentals of the C language.
<br>
As I progressed, I implemented various concepts such as:
<br>
- Nested loops<br>
- If-else-if statements<br>
- Random number generation<br>
- Arrays<br>
- Pointers<br>
- String manipulation<br>
- Basic logic building<br>
<br>
Each project demonstrates a specific stage in my learning journey, and you will notice the increasing complexity as you go through them.<br>
<br>
Feel free to explore the code and suggest improvements!
