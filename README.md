Beginner-level C projects showcasing my growth in programming and problem-solving skills.
<br>
This repository contains some of my best early stage projects that helped me understand the fundamentals of the C language.
<br>
As I progressed, I implemented various concepts such as:
<br>
- Nested loops
- If-else-if statements
- Random number generation
- Arrays
- Pointers
- String manipulation
- Basic logic building
<br>
Each project demonstrates a specific stage in my learning journey, and you will notice the increasing complexity as you go through them.
<br>
Feel free to explore the code and suggest improvements!
